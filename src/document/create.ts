 * The single transaction is the whole point. `addNode` and `addEdge` each open
 * one of their own, and run back to back they produce two undo entries — so
 * spawning a child off a handle would take two presses of Cmd-Z, and the first
 * would leave a dangling edge on screen. Yjs transactions nest rather than
 * stack, so wrapping both here collapses them into one entry without either
 * function having to know it is being called from inside another.
 *
 * The point is the new node's *centre*, not its corner: every caller knows
 * where the node should appear (under the pointer, off a parent's side), not
 * where its top-left should land.
